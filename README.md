ADEPT2-to-BPMN mapping

This application provide ADEPT2-to-BPMN mapping.

In folder templates can be found examples defined in ADEPT2 (folder adept).
Results posts in folder template. 

To change path for templetes you need to change it TestMain.java file.

To look at BPMN schema you need to import demo.xml in Signavio.
Sometime some errors occur because of different formating.
This problem can be solved with Sublime XML formatter (I have not tried other IDE). 
To install formatter chech this out : http://www.yellowduck.be/geek-stuff/2013/3/9/formatting-json-and-xml-with-sublime-text.
